Hello World


Hello! My name is Troy Alfelt, and I am currently a student at Thaddeus Stevens
College of Technology enrolled in the Computer Science Engineering Technology
program. Welcome to my page! Here I will show off some of my previous projects,
demonstrate my skills, and let you get to know me a little better. Please enjoy
your stay.
