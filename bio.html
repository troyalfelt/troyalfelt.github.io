I was born in 1995 to my parents Anders and Peg. I grew up in Christiana, a
small town. I attended the Octorara School District where I graduated with honors.
I entered the world of work for five years after graduation, unsure what field
I wanted to enter. After finding retail work unfufilling, I started to work
on Codeacademy and was immediately smitten. I decided to enroll in Thaddeus
Stevens College of Technology as soon as possible. I am currently studying
under the Compueter Science and Engineering Technology program. My interests
include playing bass and playing too many video games. I live in an apartment
with some roommates and an ill-behaved cat.
